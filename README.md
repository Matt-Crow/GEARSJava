# GEARS

TODO:
* remove placeholder area from HomePage

Current Plan:
* Make all core classes:
    * tile
    * tile map
    * entities
    * machines
    * structures
    * item (can pick up)
* add factories for each
* add serialization for each

Need sprite loader
Add ability to pick up gears the player placed

WASD to move,
I to use current item (placeholder until I have an inventory), 
R to regenerate randomly generated world
L to log the world to System.out
