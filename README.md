# GEARS
Currently just a toolkit for allowing me to create games.

## Summary
Since I currently work on a semester-by-semester basis, not being employed in between, I find it helpful to create game projects to maintain my skills over the break.
Seeing as I have my Associate of Science in Java, I find it helpful to practice this language, as I have done to a great extent in [Orpheus](https://github.com/Matt-Crow/Orpheus).
Unfortunately, Orpheus has gotten rather large and difficult to work with, so I wanted to practice Java using something a bit simpler (preferably without socket programming...).
GEARS is mostly a collection of game mechanics I've had for some time. I made an early version of this game several years ago in my [other GEARS repository](https://github.com/Matt-Crow/GEARS),
though these versions have diverged significantly in their designs and general ideas. 

TODO:
* remove placeholder area from HomePage

Current Plan:
* Make all core classes:
    * tile
    * tile map
    * entities
    * machines
    * structures
    * item (can pick up)
* add factories for each
* add serialization for each

Need sprite loader

WASD to move,
R to regenerate randomly generated world
L to log the world to System.out
Q to interact with your current tile (such as picking up placed gears)
