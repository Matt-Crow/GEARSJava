/**
 * The core package contains classes and interfaces used by multiple different 
 * sub-packages of world.
 * 
 * These classes are used to store commonly used traits, such as coordinates and 
 * size; as well as common behaviors, such as handling collisions and player 
 * interactions.
 * 
 * In the future, I would like to add more interfaces along the lines of the 
 * Interactable interface: categorizing objects based not on what they are, but 
 * on what they do.
