/**
 * Structures are matrices of tiles which can be inserted into a TileMap. These 
 * are analogous to naturally generated structures in games such as Minecraft. 
 * 
 * Currently, these don't do much, just providing patterns to copy-paste into 
 * the TileMap, but future versions will see Structures become more complex, 
 * having their own sets of Machines and Items, becoming mini Areas in a way.
